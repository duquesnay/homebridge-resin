# homebridge-resin
HomeKit raspberry bridge to control Sonos speakers with Raspberry Pi, Docker+Resin.io containerized

This is a personal experiment, feel free to use as a tutorial.
Purpose is to experiment a bridge to HomeKit, Sonos being the immediately available device I can think off.
Dockerization + Resin is an addition since years of Raspberry experiments, on and off and across various locations, led me to beg for any deployment automatization (instead of lost wifi settings, systems with random installs, etc)
